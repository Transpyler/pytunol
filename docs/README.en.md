# Welcome to Pytunhol!


Pytunhol is an extension of Python that accepts commands in Spanish (as well as the
usual English commands). It was created using the Transpyler project tools as a demonstration of how to create translated versions for Python.

Little curiosity: I do not speak Spanish! Pytuñol uses google translate to perform automatic translations. The transpyler project was originally created to support Pytuguês and was later rewritten in English to work with any language. My original desire was to translate from Portuguese to Spanish (hence the allusion to portunhol), but it became more practical to base all translations on the English version of Transpyler.

This project exists as a template for anyone who wants to start a new Python translation and to provoke the Spanish-speaking community to take over the tool and create a serious language from there. Can someone volunteer and make a cookie cutter?
